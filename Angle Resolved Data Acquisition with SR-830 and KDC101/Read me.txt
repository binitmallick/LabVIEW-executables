This user interface is very specific to an experiment where the optical response data from a specimen is involved with the orientation of the polarization of the incident light or the orientation of the sample itself. To use this user interface one need to have SR-830 lock-in amplifier, GPIB connector, DC Servo Motor Controller (Model: KDC101 from thorlabs) with a rotation stage (connected to PC through an USB). If anyone needs to develope similar programs for the experiments with different components than the above mentioned ones, and facing a dificult time to write it.
